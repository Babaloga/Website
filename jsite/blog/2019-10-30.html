    <p>First prototype, worked by casting rays and instantiating sprites. Without any kind of batching, the performance was terrible.</p>

    <p>By moving the raycasting to the GPU I was able to nearly double the performance. I also lowered the opacity of the dots as distance from the player increased. This made it possible to scope in on distant objects, making them more visible by narrowing the visible angle.</p>
