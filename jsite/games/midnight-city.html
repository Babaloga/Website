            <p>The Midnight City is a point-and-click style adventure game that I lead the development of for a game development class in my sophomore year at the University of Utah.</p>
            <p>The game centered around a time loop mechanic, which would reset the world and the player’s location and inventory every six minutes. Midnight City was challenging from a design perspective. I stumbled quite a bit over the difficulties of designing point-and-click style puzzles, and learned a lot in the process.</p>
            <p>The highlight of the game was the introduction, which introduced the player to the idea of retaining information, rather than items, when time reset. The player would start in a hotel room with a locked safe, go to the front desk to get the code for it, and in the process lock themselves out of their room. In order to get back into their room the player would have to wait for the reset, putting them back at the start with information they didn’t have before.</p>
