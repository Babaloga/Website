    <h2>Guys™</h2>
    <h4>June 28th, 2024</h4>
    <p>In March of this year, after getting back from GDC, I started a small project to familiarize myself with Unity's Netcode in the hopes of eventually adding online multiplayer to Orbital Tilt. The idea, partly inspired by Blaseball, was to put together a goofy little demo scene where connecting players would spawn in as a featureless capsule with a randomly generated name ([FIRSTNAME] the [ADJECTIVE]).</p>

    <p>I posted a screenshot and after a positive response I decided to throw a build up on itch.io and let people in. Over the next few weeks I constantly iterated and expanded the game: adding elements to the environment, creating new name templates, and refining the netcode and physics.</p>

    <p>Early on I added a leaderboard, mostly as a joke. All it counted was how many seconds a given Guy™ had been alive. Later I added different goals, which the game would randomly cycle between. Thing like "highest altitude", "most consecutive flips", and "most kills".</p>
