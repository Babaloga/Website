            <p>Mini-Glolf was a Blaseball fan game. While other Blaseball fan games replicated the style and experience of Blaseball as an independent project, I set out to create a game that used the existing randomly-generated players from Blaseball in new ways.</p>
            <p>
                I chose mini-golf because it has many of the same qualities as baseball that make it well suited to a relatively simple simulation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Action takes place in "turns" with a static board state in between</li>
                    <li>"Turns" are short and involve players acting largely independently</li>
                    <li>The state of the game can be illustrated using a diagram of the board state</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>By the end of its run, Mini-Glolf featured a wide variety of different weathers, the ability for fans to pick "idols" and earn income from their actions using purchased items, tournaments involving different leagues that could run autonomously, and automatic rendering and export of finished games (see video below).</p>
            <p>Mini-Glolf ran for a few months before declining audience interest (largely due to the return of blaseball from its downtime) and persistent physics bugs led me to stop supporting the project.</p>
