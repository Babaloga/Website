    <h3>The Core Mechanics player logos</h3>
    <div id="player-logos" width = "100%">
        <div>
            <p>Inspired by a series of Titanfall-themed fictitious logos by reddit user raisinsucks, I created a series of logos to submit to Blaseball Cares (Blaseball's fan-run charity merch store) representing popular interpretations of players from the Blaseball team The Core Mechanics.</p>
            <p>The logos represent the personality and identity of the player through the lense of a business they might feasibly run, or just one that matches their vibe.</p>
            <p>After the first wave of logos I noticed that they all also plausibly represented the player's head or face, so I made that part of my design goals moving forward.</p>
        </div>

                <h4>Willowtree Botanical Gardens</h4>
                <h5>[ Wave 1 ]</h5>
                <p>Jolene Willowtree, star pitcher and (depending on who you ask) literal willow tree.</p>
                <p>This logo was originally only meant to depict a tree, but I noticed in retrospect that it could also be read as a profile-view of someone facing to the right, with the trunk of the tree as the front of their neck.</p>

                <h4>Suljak Glassworks</h4>
                <h5>[ Wave 1 ]</h5>
                <p>Bottles Suljak, a glass blower and blacksmith who is made of glass.</p>
                <p>I iterated on this one for a while but it ended up being one of my favorites of the set.</p>
                <p>It depicts a klein bottle, a nod to the surreal nature of the setting, and can also be read as Bottles' head facing to the left, with the negative space in the klien bottle becoming a pair of goggles.</p>

                <h4>Drumsolo Community Lounge</h4>
                <h5>[ Wave 1 ]</h5>
                <p>Kelvin Drumsolo, a drummer with flaming hair and a spiderlike prosthetic leg assembly with a built-in drum kit.</p>
                <p>This logo depicts a front-on view of a kick drum in flames, which can also be read as a stand-in for Kelvin's head and flaming hair. Originally I had the text "CORE" on the front of the drum, but it cluttered and confused the design too much.</p>

                <h4>Holbrook Arcade</h4>
                <h5>[ Wave 1 ]</h5>
                <p>Gia Holbrook, a fun-loving robot with a monitor head.</p>
                <p>Simple in concept but tricky in execution, this logo depicts the screen area of an arcade cabinet with a pair of smiling eyes on the screen. The eyes are based on a very popular depiction of the character by Blaseball community member WiresInABox.</p>
                <p>This is easily the most visually complex logo in the first wave, but I think I succeeded at boiling down the essential elements of an arcade cabinet and simplifying the shapes enough that it doesn't stand out.</p>

                <h4>Judochop Books & Comics</h4>
                <h5>[ Wave 2 ]</h5>
                <p>Adelaide Judochop, a tokusatsu-inspired action hero with a dual persona.</p>
                <p>The logo depicts an open book viewed head-on, as well as a hand chopping several boards in half. I think this is inarguably the weakest depiction of a player's face in the set by virtue of how un-face-shaped the design ended up being, but the two halves of the book can be read as a pair of eyebrows.</p>
                <p>I originally planned to call this one "Books & Unbooks" as a nod to Adelaide's notable stint with the "Subtractor" mod, but including comics felt more true to their characterization in the community, and "Comics & Uncomics" wasn't nearly as catchy.</p>

                <h5>[ Wave 2 ]</h5>
                <p>Shirai McElroy, a so-called "Textile Mechanic"</p>
                <p>This logo depicts a roll of fabric that is also a snail, a nod to Shirai's original team The Ohio Worms (which used a snail as their icon). It also represents Shirai's iconic snail-themed hard hat.</p>

                <h5>[ Wave 2 ]</h5>
                <p>Ilane Snart, a doctor who is a snake.</p>
                <p>The connection between a snake doctor and the symbolic rod of asclepius was too natural to pass up. This logo evokes that symbol by depicting a snake draped over a rod.</p>
                <p>The body of the snake forms two major loops, which evoke the round glasses that Snart is often depicted wearing. In addition, the snake has a forked tail, suggesting a forked tongue.</p>

                <h5>[ Wave 2 ]</h5>
                <p>Bees Taswell, a swarm of bees in the shape of a person.</p>
                <p>One of the more notable things about Bees Taswell was their wedding to another Bee-themed player, Inez Owens, which became a kind of community event.</p>
                <p>The logo depicts a bee trailing pollen, which is also a party ball dropping confetti. Since Bees Taswell is just a swarm of bees, depicting a single bee is as close to depicting the player's face as it's possible to get.</p>
